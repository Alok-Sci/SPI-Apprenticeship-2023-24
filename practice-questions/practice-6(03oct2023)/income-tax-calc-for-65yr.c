// Given below is a hypothetical table showing rate of Income Tax for male citizens below the age of 65 years:
// Taxable Income(TI) in Rs.                 Income Tax in Rs.
// Does not exceed Rs. 1,60,000              Nil
// Is > Rs. 1,60,000 but <=Rs. 5,00,000      [(TI-1,60,000)*10%+34,000]TI-1,60,000)*10%
// Is > Rs. 5,00,000 but <= Rs. 8,00,000     [(TI-5,00,000)*20%+34,000]
// Is > Rs. 8,00,000                         [(TI-8,00,000)*30%+94,000]

// Write a program to input the age , 
// gender(M for male or F for female) and Taxable Income of a person. 
// If the age is more than 65 years or the gendder is female, display "wrong category". 
// If the age is less than or equal to 65 years and the gender is male, 
// compute and display the Income Tax payable as per the table gives above.
